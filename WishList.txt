I wish to make a list of all the pokemon in my battle-factory game
along with their stats, to see correlations in how to play against certain
teams, so I don't get lose unexpectedly, and to see if the game randomizes
the pokemon-moveset relationship or if these are predetermined. 
(AKA keep a list of pokemon and their moveset to see if I can beat the system)


For a program this small, I would want to do it in C.
This will serve as practice for mirroring Object-Oriented Programming in C.

Need a Table struct.

And for the Table, an Entry struct.



Perhaps, I'll start with implementing the typing system, and do weaknesses/resistances/no effects.


Do I want the real stats for these pokemon? Or their base stats + EV's?



CODE NAME ADDITION, CHAR ALLOCATION
CODE REAL STATS ADDITION NOT JUST 0, OVERLOAD FUNCT
