#Some of the factory entries have more than 4 moves due to some moves being used twice. 
#The purpose of this script is to find duplicates and delete them.
#Algorithm:
#	While parse through entry, store every move seen.
#	Every time you come across a new move, check if you have already seen it.
#	If you have seen it, disregard the move.
#	If you haven't seen it, add the move to moves seen.
#	At the end, store the moves seen to the filtered entry.



#The rest of the data should pass through unaltered.
#Ordering of the data should be preserved.


#Format of entry:
#	name
#	type
#	Move Lines
#	Item
#	Nature
#	EV Lines

#So, filter out the first 2 lines which are name and type.
#Then, filter out number lines until we reach the item line, which is not a number line.
#Then, filter out the rest of the entry.
